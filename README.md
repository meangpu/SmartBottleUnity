The Smart Bottle project was created to learn how to combine <b style='color:#4db5ff;'>Arduino</b> and Unity. I used a sensor to measure the water level and sent that information to Unity. The water level was represented by a tree in the game, and if you drank enough water, the tree would grow. It was a fun way to <b style='color:#4db5ff;'>encourage drinking enough water! </b> If you have Arduino you can use code in github and test it with demo on web
